1.	Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included). 
2.	 Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celcius, fahrenheit 
[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ] 
3.	Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.  Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 
Expected Output : 
Number of even numbers : 5
Number of odd numbers : 4 
4.	How many times will the following code print "Welcome to Python"?

count = 0
while count < 10:
    print("Welcome to Python")
    count += 1
5.	What is the output of the following code?

x = 0
while x < 4:
    x = x + 1

print("x is", x)
6.	What will be displayed when the following code is executed?

    number = 6
    while number > 0:
        number -= 3
        print(number)
7.	Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output : 
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4 
buzz 
8.	Write a Python program to calculate the sum and average of n integer numbers.
9.	Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50. 
10.	What will be the output for :
x = 'abcd'
for i in range(len(x)):
    x = 'a'
    print(x)
